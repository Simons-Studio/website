        <p>
          First I will test out my initial
          <abbr title="Hyper-Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> understanding by
          adding a small <abbr title="Javascript">JS</abbr> project titled
          <strong>Eye Of The Beholder</strong>. Here is my Artist Statement:
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the Eye of The Beholder. To see colour, we determine the
          reflected wavelengths of the light that falls into our eyes, here my
          monster reflects that process by pulling the colours from its world to
          see them. My monster is defined by its impact on the world, removing
          colour, but without the destruction it cannot see. Is it erasure? The
          shapes that the monster looks at remain, they are now tones of grey.
          When I see art, I too alter it and change it, I make copies, share it,
          it inspires me. This monster is art because it was to demonstrate that
          the alteration of art by people or processes can also be art. I was
          inspired by the Beholder a monster from the game
          <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> a being that can alter its reality with
          its mind like my monster. The <em>Obliteration Room</em>, by
          <em>Yayoi Kusama</em>, a place where the participants use colour to
          create from a colourless space, also inspired me to explore the
          opposite effect.

        <p>
          This week I have been going through the
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML#beginners_tutorials"
            >MDN HTML Tutoirals</a
          >
          to aid in my fundemental understanding of the structure of websites. I
          wanted to start here instead of jumping directly into common web
          frameworks so that I know what the elements of those frameworks are
          doing under the hood.

          <time datetime="2023-08-17">2023-08-17</time>: Adding Responsive Images
        </h2>
        <p>
          This week I am learning to add images using the
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img"
            >img</a
          >,
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture"
            >picture</a
          >,
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#srcset"
            >srcset</a
          >
          and
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">svg</a>
          HTML elements. So Here I have added an image that will resize
          depending on the browser.
        </p>
        <picture>
          <source
            srcset="
              images/road-to-canberra-1920px.jpg 1920w,
              images/road-to-canberra-720px.jpg   720w
            "
            media="(orientation: landscape)"
          />
          <source
            srcset="
              images/road-to-canberra-720px-protrait.jpg 720w,
              images/road-to-canberra-480px-protrait.jpg 480w
            "
            media="(orientation: portrait)"
          />
          <img
            src="images/road-to-canberra-1920px.jpg"
            alt="Tire tracks split a grassy field, forming a road that leading toward a city in the distance."
          />
        </picture>
        <p>
          I also added some <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> into
          the document to try to make the nav bar and title more functional.
