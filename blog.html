          First I will test out my initial
          <abbr title="Hyper-Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> understanding by
          adding a small <abbr title="Javascript">JS</abbr> project titled
          <strong>Eye Of The Beholder</strong>. Here is my Artist Statement:
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the Eye of The Beholder. To see colour, we determine the
          reflected wavelengths of the light that falls into our eyes, here my
          monster reflects that process by pulling the colours from its world to
          see them. My monster is defined by its impact on the world, removing
          colour, but without the destruction it cannot see. Is it erasure? The
          shapes that the monster looks at remain, they are now tones of grey.
          When I see art, I too alter it and change it, I make copies, share it,
          it inspires me. This monster is art because it was to demonstrate that
          the alteration of art by people or processes can also be art. I was
          inspired by the Beholder a monster from the game
          <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> a being that can alter its reality with
          its mind like my monster. The <em>Obliteration Room</em>, by
          <em>Yayoi Kusama</em>, a place where the participants use colour to
          create from a colourless space, also inspired me to explore the
          opposite effect.

        <p>
          This week I have been going through the
          <a

          >
          to aid in my fundemental understanding of the structure of websites. I
          wanted to start here instead of jumping directly into common web
          frameworks so that I know what the elements of those frameworks are
          doing under the hood.

          <time datetime="2023-08-17">2023-08-17</time>: Adding Responsive Images
        </h2>
        <p>
          This week I am learning to add images using the
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img"
            >img</a

            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture"
            >picture</a
          >,
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#srcset"
            >srcset</a

          and
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">svg</a>
          HTML elements. So Here I have added an image that will resize
          depending on the browser.
        </p>

          <source
            srcset="images/road-to-canberra/road-to-canberra-480px-portrait.jpg"
            media="(orientation: portrait)"
          >
          <source 
            media="(orientation: portrait, min-width: 500px)" 
            srcset="images/road-to-canberra-720px-portrait.jpg 720w"
          />
          <source 
            srcset="images/road-to-canberra/road-to-canberra-1920px.jpg"
            media="(min-width: 799px)"

          I also added some <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> into
          the document to try to make the nav bar and title more functional.

          <time datetime="2023-08-18">2023-08-18</time>
          Adding An SVG
        </h2>
        <p>
          Today I added an <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> to the navigation bar in this website. This was to create a nice transition to the content of each page. I was introduced to the tool <a href="https://app.haikei.app">haihei</a> which creates trasitional svgs for websites like this. I learned about this tool from the an excellent <a href="https://youtu.be/lPJVi797Uy0">tutorial</a> on adding curves to websites created by <a href="https://fireship.io/">Jeff Delaney</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The colours on the website are a colour palette I created for the website using <a href="https://coolors.co">coolors</a>. The website allows users to upload an image and then extract a colour palette from the colours in the image. I use the image of <a href="index.html#self-portrait">myself</a> that is used in the front page of this website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally I leaned about CSS layouts and used the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox">flexbox layout</a> to style the header above. This allows for the elements in the header to move depending on the width of the browser.
