      Hi. I am Simon. I am a computer scientist graduate, looking to begin work
      in the industry that I love. To aid in this i am going to host some of my
      personal projects here.

      First I will test out my initial HTML understanding by adding a small JS project titled <strong>Eye Of The Beholder</strong>. Here is my Artist Statement:
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the Eye of The Beholder. To see colour, we determine the reflected wavelengths of the light that falls into our eyes, here my monster reflects that process by pulling the colours from its world to see them. My monster is defined by its impact on the world, removing colour, but without the destruction it cannot see. Is it erasure? The shapes that the monster looks at remain, they are now tones of grey. When I see art, I too alter it and change it, I make copies, share it, it inspires me. This monster is art because it was to demonstrate that the alteration of art by people or processes can also be art. I was inspired by the Beholder a monster from the game <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> a being that can alter its reality with its mind like my monster. The <em>Obliteration Room</em>, by <em>Yayoi Kusama</em>, a place where the participants use colour to create from a colourless space, also inspired me to explore the opposite effect.
